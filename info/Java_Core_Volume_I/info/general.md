### Preface
In late 1995, the Java programming language burst onto the Internet scene. \
Java is Simple, Object-Oriented, Distributed, Robust, Secure, Architecture-Neutral, Portable, Interpreted,
High-Performance,  Multithreaded,  Dynamic.

Java Applets - The idea here is simple: Users will download Java bytecodes from the Internet and run them on their own
machines. Java programs that work on web pages are called applets.

In the early days of Java, the language was interpreted. Nowadays, the Java virtual machine uses a just-in-time compiler.

## Java Programming environment
```shell
javac Welcome.java
java Welcome
```
The `javac` program is the Java compiler. It compiles the file Welcome.java into the file Welcome.class.
The `java` program launches the Java virtual machine. It executes the bytecodes that the compiler placed in the **class** file.

The `JShell` program provides a “read-evaluate-print loop,” or REPL. To start JShell, simply type `jshell` in a terminal.
Tab completion is a useful feature.
