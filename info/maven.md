Maven - program that compiles and builds you project. You can build your java code from console, via IDEA, or via some
helper program like Ant, Maven, or Gradle.

Many projects are using maven as a build tool, and it needs some configuration for itself. To not create this structure
by yourself, we can use mvn to generate a project.
Maven parses settings file, understands what is going on and passes control to his plugins.

```shell script
mvn archetypr:generate;
```

groupId - url of your company. For example if it would google - it would be "com.google".
artifactId - name of your project.
version
Those properties are uniq identifiers for you project.

pom.xml - file with maven settings.

After project structure with simple code is generated we can compile it from root folder. 
```shell script
mvn compile;
mvn test; #to run the tests
mvn package; #to create a jar file
java -cp target/my_jar_file.jar com.olehbondaruk.App
         #class pass            #what class I want to run    
```

src/main/java - for app code
src/main/resources - for media, html, and other data
src/main/test - for tests

You can run a maven plugin with some goal separately.
```shell script
mvn compiler:compile # compiler plugin makes compile goal
mvn help:describe -Dplugin=surefire # "help" plugin with "describe" goal (-D arguments) will try to find surefire plugin
# and get info about it. Also here you can find the goals of the plugin.
mvn help:describe -Dplugin=surefire -Dgoal=test #get the info about surefire test goal. (some time need -Dmojo=test ?)
```

The surefire plugin is responsible for testing.

Maven lifecycle - set of plugins that run in once, one after another.

default - handles your project deployment
    validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
    initialize - initialize build state, e.g. set properties or create directories.
    generate-sources - generate any source code for inclusion in compilation.
    process-sources - process the source code, for example to filter any values.
    generate-resources - generate resources for inclusion in the package.
    process-resources - copy and process the resources into the destination directory, ready for packaging.
    compile - compile the source code of the project.
    process-classes - post-process the generated files from compilation, for example to do bytecode enhancement on Java 
        classes.
    generate-test-sources - generate any test source code for inclusion in compilation.
    process-test-sources - process the test source code, for example to filter any values.
    generate-test-resources - create resources for testing.
    process-test-resources - copy and process the resources into the test destination directory.
    test-compile - compile the test source code into the test destination directory
    process-test-classes - post-process the generated files from test compilation, for example to do bytecode 
        enhancement on Java classes.
    test - run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or 
        deployed.
    prepare-package - perform any operations necessary to prepare a package before the actual packaging. This often 
        results in an unpacked, processed version of the package.
    package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
    pre-integration-test - perform actions required before integration tests are executed. This may involve things 
        such as setting up the required environment.
    integration-test - process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run.
    post-integration-test - perform actions required after integration tests have been executed. This may including 
        cleaning up the environment.
    verify - run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
    install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
    deploy - done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for 
        sharing with other developers and projects.
clean - handles project cleaning
    pre-clean - execute processes needed prior to the actual project cleaning
    clean - remove all files generated by the previous build
    post-clean - execute processes needed to finalize the project cleaning
site - handles the creation of your project's site documentation.
    pre-site - execute processes needed prior to the actual project site generation
    site - generate the project's site documentation
    post-site - execute processes needed to finalize the site generation, and to prepare for site deployment
    site-deploy - deploy the generated site documentation to the specified web server

So all job is done with plugins, e.g. to copy resources to target, and compile java code - we need something like: 
```shell script
mvn resources:resources compiler:compile surefire:test
```
But this is too long, so instead you just type.
```shell script
mnv compile test
```
And all these plugins is run one after another.
NOTE: if you run the "compile" default lifecycle step, that means maven will run all previous to compile steps like
initialize, generate, ... process-resources.

maven_folder/lib/maven-model-builder-3.6.3 - here is a super POM, basic pom.xml. And all your settings that you've
added in your project pom.xml - is overriding setting from a basic pom.xml.
The effective pom - it's a mix from super POM and your project's pom.xml.

```shell script
mvn help:effective-pom; # will show current state of your pom.xml
``` 

<myPoperty>My_Property_value</myPoperty>
<version>${project.myPoperty}-beta</version>
You can get some properties of your project with template string syntax ${}.
